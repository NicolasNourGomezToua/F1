	<div class="container-fluid">â €<p>F1's is a story of restless technical development, characterised by gritty stories of heroism and human endeavour. Our champions past and present will always bring F1 to life: Emerson Fittipaldi ignited the passion of his native Brazil; James Hunt created as many headlines on the front pages as he did on the back; Niki Lauda and Alain Prost turned sport to science; the burning intensity of Ayrton Senna will live forever, while Mika Hakkinen and Lewis Hamilton are remembered for their fearless aggression.</p></div>

The Lotus 79, which refined the ground-effect concept and dominated the 1978 F1 season, ticks all the boxes for this list. It's also even more impressive close up in the flesh than it is in the famous period images of Mario Andretti and Ronnie Peterson.

Lower, neater and sleeker than the Lotus 78 that preceded it, the 79 won on its debut in the Belgian GP in the hands of Andretti and finished 1-2 next time out in Spain. It was only beaten to pole once during the campaign, though the odd reliability issue and jump-start penalty for Andretti at Monza meant it only won six of the 11 championship rounds it started in 1978.</p></li></ul>
